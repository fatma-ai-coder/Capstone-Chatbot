They can change their major after the approval of the \\nScholarship Committee and will, consequently, bear the resulting extra cost.\\nGrading System and Operations \\nGrade Reports\\nAt the conclusion of each semester, the student can obtain her grade report from the SIS.\\n Grading System\\nThe following grading system is followed at Dar Al-Hekma University:30Grading System\\nThe following grading system is followed at Dar Al-Hekma University:\\nGrades Symbol and Deﬁnition \\n  \\nA+ : Exceptional\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 95-100% and indicates an outstanding achievement of distinction.\\nA : Excellent \\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 90-94% and indicates a superior achievement of distinction.\\nB+: Very Good\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 85-89% and indicates very good extensive achievement.\\nB: Good\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 80-84 % and indicates good extensive achievement.\\nC+: Above Average\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 75-79% and indicates an above average achievement.\\nC: Average\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 70-74% and indicates satisfactory achievement.\\nD+ : High Pass\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 65-69% and indicates a high pass achievement.\\nD: Pass\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of 60-64 % and indicates minimal achievement.\\nF: Fail\\nEquivalent to a numerical grade of less than 60% and indicates inadequate achievement and the course must be repeated to secure credits.\\nDN: Denial\\nIndicates that a student was administratively dropped from a course due to exceeding the allowed absence limit.\\nIP: In Progress\\nIs given only for research-based courses which require more than one semester for completion. Upon completion, the \"IP\" grade is replaced with the new earned grade.\\nIC: Incomplete\\nIs given to students who completed a minimum of 60% of the course work requirements and passed them but are not able to take the ﬁnal exam, or complete\\n the ﬁnal project on the due date for a valid reason submitted ahead of time.\\nAF: Absence Failure\\nIs a temporary grade assigned to students who completed a minimum of 60% of the course work requirements and passed them but failed to attend the ﬁnal exam,\\n or submit the ﬁnal project on the due date and time without previous notice.\\nW: Withdrawal\\nIndicates that the student withdrew from a course within the allowed time period.\\nNP: No grade – Pass\\nIs assigned for Pass/Fail-based courses and is equivalent to a numerical grade of 70% & above. A grade of \"NP\" is also assigned to courses transferred from \\nother higher education institutions.\\nNF: No grade – Fail\\nIs assigned for Pass/Fail-based courses only and is equivalent to a numerical grade of less than 70%.\\n31Grade Point Average\\nDar Al-Hekma University uses a ﬁve-point grade system for calculating the Grade Point Average \\n(GPA) and adopts the following equivalent grade points for each grade symbol\\nA+ = 5.00 points\\nA = 4.75 points\\nB+ = 4.50 points\\nB = 4.00 points\\nC+ = 3.50 points\\nC = 3.00 points\\nD+ = 2.50 points\\nD = 2.00 points\\nF or DN = 1.00 point\\nSemester Grade Point Average\\nThe Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA) is calculated as the total number of grade points earned \\nper credit hour divided by the total credit hours in a semester.\\nCumulative Grade Point Average\\nThe Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is calculated as the total number of grade points \\nearned per credit hour divided by the total credit hours in all the courses taken at Dar Al-Hekma \\nUniversity. The grades of transferred courses from other universities are not used to calculate the \\nCGPA.\\nThe grade of \"NP\" does not receive grade points, and therefore, does not affect the GPA calculation. \\nWhile the grades of \"IP,\" \"IC,\" and \"AF\" receive no grade points and not impact the calculation of \\nCGPA. Dar Al-Hekma University considers the credits in which these grades are received to be \\nattempted, but not successfully completed, and therefore, will decrease the overall successful course \\ncompletion percentage until given grade points. \\nThe grades of \"NF\" and \"W\" bear no grade points, and therefore, do not inﬂuence the calculation of \\nCGPA. In this case, the University considers the credits in which these grades are received to be \\nattempted, but not successfully completed, and therefore, will decrease the overall successful course \\ncompletion percentage.\\nGrading Operations\\nDar Al-Hekma University follows the policies rules below in grading operations.\\nGrade Submission\\nThe ﬁnal grades of a course are posted on the on the Student Information System (SIS) for the \\nstudent view within a maxim period of three days from the course ﬁnal exam date.\\nChanging of a Grade\\nThe allowed period to change a grade is during the semester following the course ﬁnal exam date. \\nDuring the allowed period, the course instructor has the right to change a grade of a student if the \\ninstructor provides a valid justiﬁcation for the change approved by the respective Department Chair \\nand the Dean of School.32Withdrawal from a Course\\nA student may withdraw from a course during the period speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar if she is \\nhaving difﬁculty in the course; experiencing serious medical problems, not being able to develop the \\nrequired skills to pass the course or having other valid reasons. Such a decision needs to be \\ndiscussed with the academic advisor while taking into consideration that a minimum course load of 12 \\nSemester Credit Hours (SCH) must be maintained after withdrawal. DAH, Takaful, and Al-Elm \\nscholarship students must receive an approval from the Scholarship Unit to complete their process. \\nAn approval will be granted if it does not affect her graduation. The student will be allowed to withdraw \\nfrom the same course a maximum of two times.\\nA student who wishes to withdraw from a course must complete a \"Course Withdrawal E-form\" \\n(available in the Petition System). If a student stops attending classes without ofﬁcially withdrawing \\nfrom the course, she will receive a \"DN\" grade in that course. \\nThe following will be implemented if the student withdraws from a course:\\n1. The student will receive a grade of \"W\", which is not calculated towards the student\\'s CGPA.\\n2. The credit hours from a withdrawn course are counted as attempted (but not earned) when \\ncalculating the student\\'s minimum completion rate of 67%, which is the minimum rate that a student \\nmust complete of her attempted credit hours each semester to graduate within the Maximum Time \\nFrame (MTF) of her Program of Study (POS).\\nApplication for an Incomplete Grade\\nA student has the right to apply for a grade of Incomplete \"IC\" in a course if she is unable to take the \\nﬁnal exam or submit the ﬁnal project on the due date due to circumstances, including but not limited \\nto, health problems or a death in the family. In this case, the student must complete the \"Request for \\nIncomplete Grade) E-Form\" (available in the Petition System) before the due date of the ﬁnal exam. \\nDuring the application process, the student must upload the necessary documents to validate the \\nreasons she claims for not being able to complete the course ﬁnal requirement.\\nThe course instructor assigns a grade of \"IC\" to the student if the following conditions are met:\\n1. Successfully completing a minimum of 60% of the course work requirements. \\n2. Providing enough documents that support the application.\\nThe course instructor and the Department Chair have the right to decline rescheduling a ﬁnal exam for \\nany student if the latter fails to provide valid reasons and supporting evidence for having missed the \\nexam.\\nA student who misses a ﬁnal exam and fails to ofﬁcially apply for the grade of \"IC\", receives a grade \\nof Absence Failure \"AF\". A student who fails to show up within one week of the missed ﬁnal exam date \\nand submit authentic documents to support her absence will receive the so far earned grade in that \\ncourse. If the student shows up within the one-week period with valid document to support her \\nabsence, the instructor will change the grade of \"AF\" to \"IC\" and reschedules the ﬁnal exam.\\nRemoval of an Incomplete Grade\\nA student who receives a grade of \"IC\" must deliver the incomplete work of the course within eight \\nweeks after the initial ﬁnal exam date for that course. If the student fails to deliver the work within the \\nidentiﬁed period, she receives the so far earned grade of the course. Any student who has an \\'IC\" \\ngrade on her transcript will not be able to graduate.\\n 334.The course must match 80% of the content of a similar course offered at Dar Al-Hekma University. \\n5.If the course does not fulﬁl the criteria mentioned in the fourth point, the credits are transferred as \\na General Education Elective course or a Free Elective course with the exact number of the credits \\ntaken. \\n6.The Arabic or Islamic courses studied at local higher education institutions are transferred as \\nArabic or Islamic courses with the exact number of credits taken.\\n7.Transfer students do not earn grade points for the transferred courses. The Registration Unit \\nconsiders the credits taken for the transferred courses only and designates the grade of \"No grade – \\nPass\" (NP) for each transferred course.\\n8.The credits of the transferred courses are counted into the Maximum Time Frame (MTF) of the \\nprogram at Dar Al Hekma University. \\nLimitation on the Number of Credits Allowed to be Transferred from Other \\nUniversities\\nDar Al-Hekma University allows students to transfer a maximum of 50% of the total credit hours \\nrequired for their graduation at the University. Transfer students must complete at least 60% of their \\njunior and senior year courses at Dar Al-Hekma University. No credits will be transferred if they \\nexceed the Program of the Study (POS) requirements. \\nChange of Major or Track\\nInitially, a student speciﬁes the intended academic major or track on the Undergraduate Admission \\nApplication and later the student has right to change the major she applied to. However, the decision \\nto change an academic major is a matter of great signiﬁcance and should be pursued only after \\nthoughtful deliberation. Students who change majors must meet all requirements of the new major. A \\nchange of major or track may consequently lead to a time extension beyond the typical eight \\nsemesters of academic study.\\nA student who wishes to change her major must ﬁrst consult with the Counselling and Career \\nAdvising Ofﬁce at the University to review the Professional Interest Test (PIT) results.\\nStudents can apply to change their majors by completing the \"Change of Major E-from\" (available in \\nthe Petition System) within the change of major period speciﬁed in the Academic Calendar.

The student may seek support from the Student Counselor (if needed). If the student is not \\nsatisﬁed with the informal resolution, she may submit a written grievance to the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs \\n(within 6 weeks from the dispute issue). Furthermore, a student is under no obligation to go through the \\ninformal resolution process if she prefers not to and may resort to the formal resolution procedure directly. \\nOnce the Ofﬁce of Student Affairs receives the written grievance, it will be forwarded to the concerned \\ndivision.\\nB. Formal Resolution\\nThe Department Chair/ Dean of the concerned school appoints in writing an impartial fact-ﬁnding panel \\nof up to 3 persons to investigate all the issues related to the grievance with the terms and conditions of \\nthe investigation. The appointed grievance panel performs an investigation and submits a written report \\nto the concerned Department Chair or Dean that includes any facts and conclusions made. The \\nchairperson of the Grievance committee is responsible to hold a hearing within 15 days and come with a \\nverdict. Department chair or Dean must then submit a written decision within 5 days from the receipt of \\nthe Panel’s Report to both the student and the alleged person that has caused the grievance with \\nexplanations of any decisions taken and/or remedial actions.\\nC. Appeal to the Provost is missing\\nIf the student is not satisﬁed with the formal resolution by the department /school, she may appeal the \\ndecision by submitting a written appeal to the Provost within 15 days (I couldn’t ﬁnd anything related to \\nthis part in the policy of the written decision. The Provost takes further investigative actions or call for the \\nStudent Academic Committee meeting to investigate the case further. A written decision is then \\nsubmitted to both the student and the department concerned within 15 days of receipt of the appeal.\\nD. Appeal of Formal Resolution\\nIf the student is not satisﬁed with the formal resolution, she will submit the appeal to the Provost who will \\ncall for an academic grievance committee and share decision with the student, department and student \\naffairs ofﬁce.\\nComputer Use Policy\\nIndividuals who are provided access to University computer facilities and to the campus-wide \\ncommunication network assume responsibility for their appropriate use.

The grades of transferred courses from other universities are not used to calculate the CGPA.\\n\\nThe grade of \"NP\" does not receive grade points, and therefore, does not affect the GPA calculation. While the grades of \"IP,\" \"IC,\" and \"AF\" receive no grade points and not impact the calculation of CGPA. Dar Al-Hekma University considers the credits in which these grades are received to be attempted, but not successfully completed, and therefore, will decrease the overall successful course completion percentage until given grade points.\\n\\nThe grades of \"NF\" and \"W\" bear no grade points, and therefore, do not influence the calculation of CGPA. In this case, the University considers the credits in which these grades are received to be attempted, but not successfully completed, and therefore, will decrease the overall successful course completion percentage.\\n\\nGrading Operations Dar Al-Hekma University follows the policies rules below in grading operations.\\n\\nGrade Submission The final grades of a course are posted on the on the Student Information System (SIS) for the student view within a maxim period of three days from the course final exam date.\\n\\nChanging of a Grade\\n\\nThe allowed period to change a grade is during the semester following the course final exam date.

The student will receive a grade of \"W\", which is not calculated towards the student\\'s CGPA.\\n\\n2. The credit hours from a withdrawn course are counted as attempted (but not earned) when calculating the student\\'s minimum completion rate of 67%, which is the minimum rate that a student must complete of her attempted credit hours each semester to graduate within the Maximum Time Frame (MTF) of her Program of Study (POS).\\n\\nApplication for an Incomplete Grade\\n\\nA student has the right to apply for a grade of Incomplete \"IC\" in a course if she is unable to take the final exam or submit the final project on the due date due to circumstances, including but not limited to, health problems or a death in the family.

A student who fails to show up within one week of the missed final exam date and submit authentic documents to support her absence will receive the so far earned grade in that course. If the student shows up within the one-week period with valid document to support her absence, the instructor will change the grade of \"AF\" to \"IC\" and reschedules the final exam.\\n\\nRemoval of an Incomplete Grade\\n\\nA student who receives a grade of \"IC\" must deliver the incomplete work of the course within eight weeks after the initial final exam date for that course.

One or more of the following disciplinary sanctions may be imposed upon a student. Parents/guardians will be informed of those sanctions.\\n\\nImposition of Certain Tasks\\n\\nThe student may be required to perform certain tasks such as making a restitution whether monetary or by performance of specific duties, undertaking community service activities, attending counseling sessions, or performing additional academic work not required of other students.\\n\\nRestitution\\n\\nReimbursement for damage to or misappropriation of property may take the form of appropriate service to repair or otherwise compensate for damages. Special fees or fines may be assessed.\\n\\nWarning\\n\\nA verbal or a written notice to the offender indicating that the continuation and/or repetition of the wrongful conduct, or any other violation of DAH rule/policy within a period stated in the warning may be the cause for more severe disciplinary action.\\n\\nLoss of Privileges\\n\\nUnder some circumstance of misconduct, the University may decide to remove/withdraw certain privileges from a student that are consistent with the offense(s). Sanctions such as prohibiting social and extracurricular activity, withholding leadership roles, or denying certain classes or memberships are options which may be applied.\\n\\nDisciplinary Probation\\n\\nThis type of probation implies the exclusion from participation in privileges or extracurricular activities for a specified period (to be clearly stated in the notice of disciplinary probation). Any violations committed while on disciplinary probation may result in a mandatory sanction of a one- semester-suspension. The sanction will be noted in the student’s discipline file until the student’s graduation\\n\\nSuspension\\n\\nSuspension prohibits the student from attending classes or activities in the University for a defined period or until specified conditions are met.

Any appeal under this section shall be made in writing within fifteen days after the delivery of the decision appealed against. In a particular case, this requirement may be waived by the President or the University Council for a good cause.\\n\\n59%\\n\\n@ Grievance Academic grievance An academic grievance is defined as an allegation by a student that a faculty member has treated her with substantial unfairness. The primary purpose of the Student Academic Grievance Committee is to ensure that DAH students could present academic grievances/appeals (e.g., grading disputes, alleged discrimination) to the Office of the Provost if the complaint is not resolved within the School/Department concerned.\\n\\nAppointment and Composition\\n\\nMembers of the Student Academic Grievance Committee are nominated by the Provost as follow:\\n\\n+ 23 full time Assistant Professors from the different Schools nominated by the Provost (with minimum five years teaching experience, two of which should be at DAHU)\\n\\n+ Director (selected from different non-academic departments — optional)\\n\\n+ Student Affairs representative\\n\\n+ Director, Office of the Provost\\n\\nTerms of Appointment: Committee members, including the chairperson, are subject to a two-year appointment with one renewal. The committee chairperson is elected by the Provost.\\n\\nA. Informal Resolution\\n\\nThe student communicates (verbally or in writing) her concerns to the person alleged to have caused the grievance. The student may seek support from the Student Counselor (if needed). If the student is not satisfied with the informal resolution, she may submit a written grievance to the Office of Student Affairs (within 6 weeks from the dispute issue). Furthermore, a student is under no obligation to go through the informal resolution process if she prefers not to and may resort to the formal resolution procedure directly. Once the Office of Student Affairs receives the written grievance, it will be forwarded to the concerned division.\\n\\nB. Formal Resolution\\n\\nThe Department Chair/ Dean of the concerned school appoints in writing an impartial fact-finding panel of up to 3 persons to investigate all the issues related to the grievance with the terms and conditions of the investigation. The appointed grievance panel performs an investigation and submits a written report to the concerned Department Chair or Dean that includes any facts and conclusions made. The chairperson of the Grievance committee is responsible to hold a hearing within 15 days and come with a verdict. Department chair or Dean must then submit a written decision within 5 days from the receipt of the Panel’s Report to both the student and the alleged person that has caused the grievance with explanations of any decisions taken and/or remedial actions.\\n\\nC. Appeal to the Provost is missing\\n\\nIf the student is not satisfied with the formal resolution by the department /school, she may appeal the decision by submitting a written appeal to the Provost within 15 days (I couldn’t find anything related to this part in the policy of the written decision. The Provost takes further investigative actions or call for the Student Academic Committee meeting to investigate the case further. A written decision is then submitted to both the student and the department concerned within 15 days of receipt of the appeal.\\n\\nD. Appeal of Formal Resolution\\n\\nIf the student is not satisfied with the formal resolution, she will submit the appeal to the Provost who will call for an academic grievance committee and share decision with the student, department and student affairs office.\\n\\n@ Computer Use Policy\\n\\nIndividuals who are provided access to University computer facilities and to the campus-wide communication network assume responsibility for their appropriate use. The University expects students to be careful, honest, responsible, and civil in the use of computers and networks. Be advised that, in addition to being in violation of the University rules, certain computer misconduct is prohibited under Saudi Arabia General Laws. Such misconduct includes knowingly gaining unauthorized access to a computer system or database, falsely obtaining electronic services or data without paying the required charges, and destroying electronically processed, stored, or in-transit data.\\n\\n60%\\n\\nUsernames and Passwords\\n\\nUsers are responsible for safeguarding their passwords. Passwords should be obscure and contain the following:\\n\\n+ 8 characters or longer in length.\\n\\n+ At least one number.\\n\\n+ At least one upper case letter.\\n\\n+ At least one lower case letter.\\n\\nPasswords should never be shared with anyone claiming to be the Administrator. DAH security policy requires that users change their e-mail passwords once every 4 months to maximize the protection to their accounts.\\n\\nViruses\\n\\nUsers should not open attachments in e-mail from unknown senders. Attachments can contain dangerous computer viruses, which are frequently spread via email. Anyone suspecting that they have a computer virus should report the incident to the IT department.\\n\\nWeb Access Policy Access to electronic mail through Web Client Software is subject to the same policies and guidelines as email obtained via a desktop client.\\n\\nAbuse\\n\\nThose found to be abusing their DAH email account shall be referred to the office of Student Affairs and will be subject to:\\n\\n+ First violation: A written warning\\n\\nSecond violation: A written warning\\n\\nThird and consequent violations: The access account will be revoked\\n\\n612\\n\\nWe ie <\\n\\nDAR AL-HEKMA UNIVERSITY\\n\\nDepartments Facilities\\n\\ne Computer Science: -Saoucene Mahfoudh, Dr. (Assistant Professor/ ViceDean) smahfoudh@dah.edu.sa Room #: 158\\n\\nAnas Al Tirawi, Dr. ( Assistant Professor /Program Director) atirawi@dah.edu.sa Room # : 000\\n\\ne Cybersecurity: -Hashim Alaidarous, Dr.( Assistant Professor/ Chair Cybersecurity)\\n\\nhaidarous@dah.edu.sa Room #: 72-B\\n\\nHomam E]-Taj, Dr.( Assistant Professor/Program Director)\\n\\nhtaj@dah.edu.sa Room # : 72-C\\n\\ne Psychology -Aisha Hawsawi, Dr.( Assistant Professor, PROG.

The Registration Unit is responsible for conducting the registration process for new students, returning students in the University Academic Preparation Program, and returning students who have completed the program. All students must maintain a course load of 12-18 semester credit hours, except for summer session when the course load is 1-7 SCH. Tuition fees for non-Saudi students are subject to VAT.'"
